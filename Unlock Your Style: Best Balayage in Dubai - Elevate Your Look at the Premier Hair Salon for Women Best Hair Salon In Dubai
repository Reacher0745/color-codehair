Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
1. What is balayage, and how does it differ from traditional highlighting techniques?
Balayage is a freehand hair coloring technique that creates natural, sun-kissed highlights with seamless blending. Unlike traditional foiling methods, balayage delivers a softer, more organic look, enhancing your hair's dimension and movement. It differs from traditional highlighting techniques in its application method and the results it achieves.

2. Is balayage suitable for all hair types and lengths?
Yes, balayage is incredibly versatile and can be adapted to suit various hair types and lengths. Whether you have short or long hair, straight or curly, balayage can enhance your natural beauty and elevate your look.

3. How often do I need to touch up my balayage?
One of the benefits of balayage is its low maintenance nature. Since the color is applied in a way that mimics natural hair growth patterns, you can enjoy longer intervals between touch-ups compared to traditional highlights. Typically, you may need to refresh your balayage every few months to maintain its vibrancy and dimension.
